How to create your own DLL Class Library

I believe you understood the below concept before going into building your own DLL library.
# -> .NET Framework 3.0/4.0 Concepts
# -> Namespace, classes, action, properties and OOPS concept will be an added advantage.
# -> You can use this library in .NET Languages like PowerShell, F#, C#, VB... etc.

It is FUN but very useful.

I will upload the source code and the DLL file for your reference. 

# Lets Begin! 

You can download the DLL file from the below location

# https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4OAbH_F5SEfVW90YmV0aEd1N1U/view?usp=sharing

# HOW TO USE

  -> Download the above DLL into your project folder
  -> Inside your project window, Click on Project -> Add References -> Browse and double click on .DLL file to add inside your project.
  -> You have to call the Namespace inside your project by type  "using BClassic;" (ignore the quotes).
  -> You can call the class and method inside your project ;-) 
  
  
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can create your own instance calling the class and then declare what action it has to carry on.

Example:

  Class1 Name = new Class1("Raghavendra Hiremath G");
  
This will accept integer and short int as an input parameter. That's all it can do ;-) 

Regards,
Raghavendra.
